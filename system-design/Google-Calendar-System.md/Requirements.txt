As a user, I want to use a calendar system to create, manage, and share events

so that I can keep track of my schedule and collaborate with others effectively.

Functionality:
I want to create events (location, start time, and end time.)
I want to create recurring events that repeat daily, weekly, and so.
I want to share with others, allowing them to view or edit my events based on permissions.
I want to find time and propose changes.
