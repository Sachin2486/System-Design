Design a billing and auctioning system similar to EBay. Ebay is a multinational e-commerce corporation, facilitating online consumer-to-consumer and business-to-consumer sales. The website is free to use for buyers, but sellers are charged fees for listing items and again when those items are sold. The sellers aution their items and buyers bid on items.
